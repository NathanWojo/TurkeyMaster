TurkeyMaster.java is a program that will give you a rough estimate of the amount of oil that you should use for frying, given your sized turkey. It will also tell you how long you should cook your bird for. The way it works is it multiplies the given weight by a gallon per pound number that was created by averaging 13 different fried turkeys from the past 13 Thanksgivings.

To run TurkeyMaster.java on a Windows machine, you must first make sure you have the latest version of Java downloaded. Just Google "download Java", or go to this link: https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp

Once you have Java downloaded, simply double click on the file name "run.bat". This will execute a script to start the program.
